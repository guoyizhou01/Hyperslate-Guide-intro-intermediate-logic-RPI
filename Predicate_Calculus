Predicate Calculus includes = and Propositional Calculus

= intro:
  Meaning: It is always true that a = a
  Input: None
  Output: a = a (from nothing)
  Example: Figure 2.1

= elim:
  Meaning: Given a = b and F(a), conlcude F(b)
  Input: Two nodes, a = b and F(a)
  Output: F(b) (from node a=b and node F(a) )
  Example: Figure 2.2
  Note: F(a) does not exactly in such form, e.g. it can be a = c, and combined with a = b, it can conclude b = c.
