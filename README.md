# Hyperslate Guide

***** This is not a official guide! *****

If you are taking PHIL2140 Intro to Logic or CSCI4968/MATH4140/MATH4961/PHIL4961 Intermediate Logic with Selmer Bringsjord at RPI you may find this repository helpful, though there are barely direct answers to Hyperslate problems.

# Progress:

Propositional Calculus part is mostly completed.

I just started this project as of Oct.11, 2023, and I plan to complete it by the end of 2023. If there are anything you need to know right away please leave the question in Issues.
