# Hyperslate Guide

***** DISCLAIMER: This is not a official guide! *****

If you are taking PHIL2140 Intro to Logic or CSCI4968/MATH4140/MATH4961/PHIL4961 Intermediate Logic with Selmer Bringsjord at RPI you may find this repository helpful, though there are barely direct answers to Hyperslate problems.

# Progress:

Propositional Calculus, Predicate Calculus, First Order Logic, and Higher Order Logic are completed. Due to S4, S5, and D being very simple in hyperslate, they are not going to be included in the guide.
