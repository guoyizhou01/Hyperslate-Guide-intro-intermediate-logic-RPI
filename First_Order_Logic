First Order Logic includes ∃, ∀, and Propositional Calculus.

∃ intro:
  Meaning: Given F(x), conclude ∃x: F(x)
  Input: One node, F(x)
  Output: ∃x: F(x) (from F(x) )
  Example: Not yet available
  Note: By using ∃, you can only conclude ∃x: F(x) from F(x), but not ∃y: F(y). In other words, the input and output symbol must match. ∃2 is used when they don't match.

∃ elim:
  Meaning: Given ∃x: F(x), conclude F(x)
  Input: Two nodes, ∃x: F(x) and F(x)
  Output: F(x)
  Example: Not yet available
  Note:  By using ∃, you can only conclude F(x) from ∃x: F(x), but not F(y). In other words, the input and output symbol must match. ∃2 is used when they don't match.

∀ intro:
  Meaning: Given F(x) (from GIVEN1, GIVEN2, ...), where GIVEN1, GIVEN2, ... must be in first order, i.e., ∀x:G(x), ∃x:H(x), etc., conclude ∀x: F(x)
  Input: One node, F(x)
  Output: ∀x: F(x) (from GIVEN1, GIVEN2, ...)
  Example: Not yet available
  Note: By using ∀, you can only conclude ∀x: F(x) from F(x), but not ∀y: F(y). In other words, the input and output symbol must match. ∀2 is used when they don't match.

∀ elim:
  Meaning: Given ∀x: F(x), conclude F(x)
  Input: One node, ∀x: F(x)
  Output: F(x)
  Example: Not yet available
  Note:  By using ∀, you can only conclude F(x) from ∀x: F(x), but not F(y). In other words, the input and output symbol must match. ∀2 is used when they don't match.
