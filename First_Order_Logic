First Order Logic includes ∃, ∀, and Predicate Calculus. 

In first order logic in hyperslate, when you use ∃ or ∀, you can only replace a variable with a variable, a set with a set, a set of set with a set of set, etc.

∃ intro:
  Meaning: Given F(x), conclude ∃x: F(x)
  Input: One node, F(x)
  Output: ∃x: F(x) (from F(x) )
  Example: Figure 3.1
  
∃ elim:
  Meaning: Given ∃x: F(x) and F(x) (from GIVEN1, GIVEN2, ...), where all of GIVEN1, GIVEN2, ... shou be in first order, i.e., ∀x:G(x), ∃x:H(x), etc., conclude ∀x: F(x), conclude F(x)
  Input: Two nodes, ∃x: F(x) and F(x)
  Output: F(x)
  Example: Figure 3.2
  
∀ intro:
  Meaning: Given F(x) (from GIVEN1, GIVEN2, ...), where all of GIVEN1, GIVEN2, ... shou be in first order, i.e., ∀x:G(x), ∃x:H(x), etc., conclude ∀x: F(x)
  Input: One node, F(x)
  Output: ∀x: F(x) (from GIVEN1, GIVEN2, ...)
  Example: Figure 3.3
  
∀ elim:
  Meaning: Given ∀x: F(x), conclude F(x)
  Input: One node, ∀x: F(x)
  Output: F(x)
  Example: Figure 3.4
